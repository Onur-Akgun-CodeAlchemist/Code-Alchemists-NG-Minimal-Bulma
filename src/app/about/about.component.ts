          <p>Why are we even called Code Alchemists?</p>
          <p>The motivation came from writing all sorts of "Code", such as Java and JavaScript</p>
          <p>Alchemy is an ancient science where the Alchemists experimented in their quest to turn lead into gold. </p>
          <p>Although they didn't succeed in turning lead into gold, they DID manage to make a lot of progress and pave the the way for modern sciences such as:</p>
          <li>Medicine</li>
          <li>Chemistry</li>

          <p>The focus on experiments was ultimately the motivating factor to call the company Code Alchemists</p>
